# About the project  
### Still on progress  

Wanted to implement an analytics front-end style... So it's still on very early stages.  
If anyone wants to contribute or fix a bug, something i did wrong or implement something in a wrong way feel free to report it or open an issue or just contact me ,i'll be more than happy to help/take advices for better coding design and style.  
This is a product of pure testing both on javascript and css.I didn't had something in particular on my mind for design, as far as it concerns the logic part i'll add the calculations and more.
